<H1>About us</H1>

<P>Prior to its split in August 2000, Accenture was known as Anderson Consultancy and was a separate unit of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC) along with Arthur Anderson. The tension between Anderson Consultancy and Arthur Andersen was at its peak throughout the 1990s. Upset by the fact that Andersen Consultancy was paying 15% of its profit to Arthur Consultancy every year and also with the newly established business service called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC) which competed directly with Andersen Consultancy in market share. Andersen Consultancy filed a breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen and broke all contractual ties. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.
